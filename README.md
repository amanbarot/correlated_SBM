Code for simulations of correlated stochastic block models

This repository contains code for simulating two possibly correlated networks where each network is a sample from a stochastic block model (SBM). 
The two networks are then fitted in two different ways using penalizations based on the model parameters.
The effect of the penalizations can be studied using plots generated from the code. 
The repository also contains code to measure edge/link prediction using the fitted model parameters.
